# Am I Dark Mode?

A simple webapp that detects your system-wide dark mode setting.

Check it out [here](https://darkmode.screwage.net/).

## This is stupid... Why?

Because I googled "dark mode detector" on google and nothing showed up and that made me exhale out of my nose a little.

## How It Works

Uses CSS `prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect your system's color preference. Read more about that [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) <sub>if you're some kinda nerd.</sub>

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support `prefers-color-scheme`. If your browser doesn't support it, [consider updating](https://caniuse.com/?search=prefers-color-scheme).
